A Ruby class that implements a letter-based grading

system (A+, A, A-, ...).  The class should be able to naturally

sort by the value of grade (i.e., A+ > A > A-).  The class

should be constructed with a string-value for the grade.

 

a_plus = Grade.new("A+")

a      = Grade.new("A")

a_plus > a       # should return true

[a_plus, a].sort # should return [a, a_plus]
